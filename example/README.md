# Flutter Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Instana agent package with Flutter apps.

## Runing the example

Please open the [lib/main.dart](lib/main.dart) file and replace the default 'KEY' and 'REPORTING_URL' with you own Instana **key** and **reporting url**.

Then just run the app as you would normally do. For example, running this command in the terminal:

```
flutter run
```
